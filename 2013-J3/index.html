    <h1>From 1987 to 2013</h1>
    <blockquote>You might be surprised to know that 2013 is the first year since 1987 with distinct digits. The years
        2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 each have distinct digits. 2012 does not have distinct digits,
        since the digit 2 is repeated.
        Given a year, what is the next year with distinct digits? </blockquote>
